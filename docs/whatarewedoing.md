## aims and objectives...
* Multi level profile for encoding with some kind of compliance level. 
* Raster or vector data packaging – the prime use case for raster in marine processing is for bathymetry but other raster products are being proposed. 
* Vector data packaging for ISO type vector feature data including at least IHO S-57 and S-100 based product specifications, starting with s-57 ENC and IHO S-101.
* Full support for S-100 features
* Harmonised for all feature catalogues and raster datasets
* Coverage including multiple scales / datasets in a single geopackage
* Dataset and discovery metadata
* A portrayal model including catalogue and implementation examples including scaled features
* Simple and Complex attribution
* Level 3a geometry and topology
* Full range of S-100 datums and geometry types.
* Multiple association types
* Auxiliary file embedding
* Embedded Feature catalogue and binding encoding
* Digital signatures (Part 15) for authentication of sources
* Embedded Symbology for embedding in GIS and Geoserver-like web containers?
* Supported by test data and conformance/validity tests.
* Spatial indexing
* Scalability from single feature to global datasets as required
